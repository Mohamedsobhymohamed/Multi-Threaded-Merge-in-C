# Multi-Threaded-Merge-in-C
This project implements the merge sort algorithm in C with a multithreaded approach using POSIX threads (pthread). It provides two versions of merge sort: one with traditional single-threaded sorting, and another that utilizes multiple threads to sort the array in parallel.
